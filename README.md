# Movie Recommender Systems

This repository contains implementations of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques for building movie recommender systems. By utilizing these two distinct methods, the system can provide movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie features.

### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a recommender system for movies using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
- **Filtering Techniques**:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Builds recommendations based on the preferences of similar users.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes a neural network to recommend movies based on the content and features of the movies themselves.

### Key Features
- **Collaborative Filtering Implementation**:
  - Uses user-item interactions to identify patterns and recommend movies.
  - Provides recommendations based on similarities in user preferences.

- **Content-Based Filtering Implementation**:
  - Leverages a neural network model to analyze movie features.
  - Recommends movies based on similarities between a movie's content and user interests.
